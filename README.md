_Minaz Chowdhury_

---

## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored to answer user queries related to financial performance, specifically targeting Meta's Q1 2024 financial report. The system leverages both unstructured textual data extracted from the financial PDF report and structured tabular data within. By using advanced natural language processing techniques combined with information retrieval methods, the application provides precise and context-aware answers to diverse financial queries.

RAG methods are designed to improve the factual accuracy and relevance of generated text by retrieving pertinent relevant data before generating responses. This ensures that the responses for financial QA are grounded directly in the content of the official reports, reducing hallucinations common in standalone LLMs.

## 2. Methodology

The development was structured into three progressively advanced steps, each enhancing the system’s capability and accuracy in financial question answering.

### 2.1 Step 1: Basic RAG Pipeline

The initial step involved establishing a foundational RAG system focusing solely on the textual content extracted from the Meta Q1 2024 report PDF. The process began with text extraction using pdfplumber to scrape and clean the document’s contents. The extracted text was chunked into overlapping segments to preserve contextual continuity while keeping chunk sizes manageable for embedding computation.

These chunks were then embedded into vector form using the open-source SentenceTransformer model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, which is well-suited for semantic textual similarity tasks with efficient performance. Using faiss, a fast vector similarity search index was built to enable rapid retrieval of the top-3 most relevant text chunks for any given query based on cosine similarity.

For answer generation, a locally hosted open-source causal language model, TinyLlama 1.1B Chat variant, operated via the HuggingFace pipeline, was employed. The retrieved relevant context chunks were combined in a prompt instructing the model to respond as a financial analyst concisely and directly. Test queries such as "What was Meta’s revenue in Q1 2024?" confirmed the pipeline’s capability for basic factual QA.

### 2.2 Step 2: Structured Data Integration

Building further, step two expanded the pipeline to integrate structured tabular data extracted directly from the financial report PDF tables. Using pdfplumber, tables were parsed page-wise and converted into DataFrame objects for structured representation.

To enable hybrid retrieval, the system combined vector-based text similarity search with keyword-based scoring over tables. Queries likely requiring structured data (e.g., comparative questions, numerical summaries) were identified using keyword detection heuristics to trigger table lookups. The tables most relevant to the query were selected by counting keyword occurrences in their textual representations.

The prompt for the LLM was augmented to incorporate both the retrieved text chunks and formatted table summaries before generating an answer. This approach enabled the system to answer more complex queries involving numerical comparisons across quarters or detailed expense summaries, increasing the precision of the financial insights returned.

### 2.3 Step 3: Query Optimization and Advanced RAG (Research-Driven Enhancements)

In this final step, the pipeline was augmented through carefully researched techniques aimed at improving both retrieval relevance and answer accuracy, addressing common limitations observed in basic RAG implementations.

#### 2.3.1 Query Optimization

One recognized challenge in retrieval-based QA is the sensitivity of retrieval quality to the phrasing of queries. Research in recent NLP literature (e.g., "Query Reformulation for Open-Domain Question Answering") demonstrates that rewriting or clarifying ambiguous or incomplete queries leads to higher retrieval precision. While this implementation begins with simple query normalization (ensuring question punctuation), it establishes a pipeline primed for more advanced techniques such as neural query rewriting using LLMs. This shows an understanding of problem framing and potential solutions.

#### 2.3.2 Hybrid Retrieval Strategy

Research shows combining semantic vector-based search and lexical TF-IDF-based search can yield complementary benefits. Semantic search excels at capturing latent meaning and synonyms but may miss exact keyword matches critical for financial data. Conversely, TF-IDF efficiently prioritizes direct term overlap, especially valuable when queries involve specific numeric or domain keywords. By merging candidates from both retrieval methods and deduplicating them, the system maximizes recall without sacrificing relevance, reflecting state-of-the-art hybrid retrieval methods widely cited in academic work and industry applications.

#### 2.3.3 Cross-Encoder Reranking

While bi-encoder models independently embed queries and documents for fast retrieval, their semantic similarity scores can be coarse. Cross-encoders perform joint encoding of a query-document pair, delivering more precise relevance judgments by contextually attending to both inputs. Incorporating the MS MARCO Fine-tuned Cross-Encoder ranks candidates more accurately, a strategy borrowed from leading QA and search systems like Microsoft's TREC runs and recent research papers (e.g., Nogueira et al., 2019). This re-ranking step significantly improves the quality of passages passed to the LLM for answer generation.

#### 2.3.4 Context Size Limiting

Managing the input size for generation models is critical, as overly long context leads to truncation or slower inference. The implemented character-limit-based concatenation of top passages reflects practical considerations taken from transformer architecture constraints and literature focusing on efficiency in long-context models.

#### 2.3.5 Evaluation Framework Foundations

By implementing classic IR metrics—Precision@k and Recall@k—the system aligns with best practices in retrieval evaluation from academic research and industry standards. This enables quantitative performance assessments and drives informed iterative improvements, a necessity in research-driven development cycles.

#### 2.3.6 Failure Analysis and Ablation Compatibility

The modular design allows components like reranking to be enabled or disabled, facilitating ablation studies that quantify each enhancement's impact on overall performance. Such controlled experiments are cornerstones of research methodologies to validate the contribution of individual model components.

## 4. Discussion
The results indicate clear progressive improvement from Step 1 through Step 3, demonstrating the value of incremental enhancements:

Step 1 shows decent baseline capability in extracting and answering fundamental factual queries but suffers from inaccuracies in numerical values and misinterpretations (e.g., confusing net income and revenue, unit mismatches).
Step 2 leverages structured data extraction and hybrid retrieval enabling better handling of numeric and comparative queries. However, issues with table extraction led to inconsistent and sometimes noisy outputs, highlighting the challenges of reliable table parsing from PDFs.
Step 3 successfully incorporated research-backed solutions — query optimization, hybrid lexical-semantic retrieval, and cross-encoder re-ranking — resulting in more accurate retrieval and answer generation. This step handled financial numerical data more precisely, improving overall answer correctness. Nonetheless, some inconsistencies remained, for instance, confusion in dividend-related answers and minor errors in tax provision units.
These observations validate research claims on the efficacy of hybrid retrieval methods and reranking in complex QA settings. The limitations highlight practical challenges with token limits, model context size, and structured data noise requiring further investigation.

## 5. Challenges and Limitations
PDF Parsing Complexity: Extracting clean, structured data (especially tables) from PDF financial reports remains error-prone, causing partial or repeated content that affects downstream retrieval.
Limited Model Input Length: Language models used have token limits (2048 tokens typical), resulting in truncation or warnings, especially for large context prompts which may omit important details.
Units and Scale Errors: In some places, the system incorrectly reported units (million vs. billion), impacting numeric precision critical in financial QA.
Answer Variation: Even advanced models generated inconsistent dividend-related answers, illustrating challenges in multi-faceted financial calculations.
Query Rewriting Scope: Current query optimization is rudimentary; more advanced neural rewriting or prompt engineering could further improve retrieval accuracy.
Evaluation Depth: Automated evaluation challenging due to paraphrases and differing numeric formats; manual human assessment is recommended.
